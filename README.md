# ECTyper (an easy typer)
`ECTyper` is a standalone versatile serotyping module for _Escherichia coli_. It supports both _fasta_ (assembled) and _fastq_ (raw reads) file formats.
The tool provides convenient species identification coupled to quality control module giving a complete, transparent and reference laboratories suitable report on *E.coli* serotyping, Shiga toxin typing and pathotyping.

# Introduction
*Escherichia coli* is a priority foodborne pathogen of public health concern and popular model organism. Phenotypic characterization such as serotyping, toxin typing and pathotyping provide critical information for surveillance and outbreak detection activities and research including source attribution, outbreak cluster assignment, pathogenicity potential, risk assessement and others. 

`ECTyper` uses whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for E.coli characterization including species identification, *in silico* serotyping covering O and H antigens, Shiga toxin typing and DEC pathotyping. It is a versatile, scallable, easy to use tool allowing to obtain key information on E.coli accepting both raw and assembled inputs.

As WGS becomes standard within public health and research laboratories, it is important to harness the high throughput and resolution potential of this technology providing accurate and rapid at scale typing of E.coli both in public health, clinical and research contexts.

# Installation
Multiple installation options are available depending on the user context and needs. The most convinient installation is as a `conda` package as it will install all required dependencies. 

### Docker and Singularity images availability
Docker and Singularity images are also available from [https://biocontainers.pro/tools/ectyper](https://biocontainers.pro/tools/ectyper) that could be useful for NextFlow or hassle-free deployment

### Databases
ECTyper uses multiple databases 
  - the species identification database is available from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10211568) repository
  - the O and H antigen allele sequences are stored in [ectyper_alleles_db.json](ectyper/Data/ectyper_alleles_db.json)
  - the toxin and pathotype signature marker sequences are stored in [ectyper_patho_stx_toxin_typing_database.json](ectyper/Data/ectyper_patho_stx_toxin_typing_database.json)

## Option 1: As a conda package
Optionally if you do not have a conda environment, get and install `miniconda` or `anaconda`:

  ```
  wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
  bash miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda

# Getting started
## Basic Usage
1. Put the fasta/fastq files for serotyping analyses in one folder (concatenate paired raw reads files if you would like them to be considered a single entity)
1. `ectyper -i [file path] -o [output_dir]`
1. View the results on the console or in `cat [output folder]/output.csv`

## Example Input Scenarios
* `ectyper -i ecoliA.fasta`  for a single file (the output folder will be named using `ectyper_<date>_<time>` pattern as `-o` is not specified)
* `ectyper -i ecoliA.fasta -o output_dir` for a single file with results stored in `output_dir` folder
* `ectyper -i ecoliA.fasta ecoliB.fastq ecoli_folder/`	for multiple files and the directory `ecoli_folder/` separated by space. Again the output folder will be named using `ectyper_<date>_<time>` pattern)
* `ectyper -i ecoliA.fasta ecoliB.fastq,ecoliC.fna` for multiple files separated by comma `,` symbol 
* `ectyper -i ecoli_folder`	scan for input files in a folder and subdirectories (all files in the folder will be checked by the tool)
* `ectyper -i ecoli_folder/*.fasta` scan for FASTA input files in a folder and subdirectories with `fasta` extension

## Main submodules descriptions

### Species identification module
ECTyper performs species identification by selecting the closest reference genome to the query input (i.e.having the smallest MASH distance) from the custom made MASH sketch currently represented by the 119,980 reference genomes with assigned taxonomy information. The enhanced ECTyper [species ID sketch](#databases) is both based on [The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB)](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) release 214 (covering all known bacteria and archaea domains) and manually curated and selected  *Escherichia* and *Shigella* genera reference genomes from the [EnteroBase](https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/species/index/ecoli) and [GenBank/RefSeq NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/) public databases.

The `comment` field of the MASH sketch uses taxonomic path from domain to species level to meet the [MikroKondo MASH sketch guidelines](https://github.com/phac-nml/mikrokondo?tab=readme-ov-file#step-4-further-resources-to-download). For example, taxonomic path for *E.coli* is formatted as such `"d__Bacteria;p__Pseudomonadota;c__Gammaproteobacteria;o__Enterobacterales;f__Enterobacteriaceae;g__Escherichia;s__Escherichia coli"`. The sketch was generated using 1000 hashes per sketch (`-s 1000`) and k-mer size of 21 (`-k 21`) that are the default `mash sketch` parameters.

The *Escherichia* and *Shigella* genera genomes sourced from EnteroBase accessed on 2023-09-07 were assembled using the [`shovill v1.1.0`](https://github.com/tseemann/shovill) assembler run on raw reads downloaded from the [NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) via the corresponding SRA accession number. The *Escherichia* and *Shigella*  RefSeq NCBI genomes were downloaded from [NCBI FTP](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) by accessing metadata from the [`assembly_summary_refseq.txt`](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ASSEMBLY_REPORTS/assembly_summary_refseq.txt) file, filtering the `organism_name` field using all known *Escherichia* and *Shigella* genera species. The reported species for the EnteroBase and RefSeq sourced genomes were verified by running the [`ShigEiFinder v1.3.5`](https://github.com/LanLab/ShigEiFinder) and checking the `SEROTYPE` field. Samples with values `SB13` (*Shigella boydii type 13*) and `Unknown` were rejected. 

For each *Escherichia* and *Shigella* species selected genomes a distance matrix was calculated by running [`mash triangle`](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/mash/mash-triangle.1.en.html) followed by the agglomerative hierarchical clustering using average linkage method via the [`linkage()` function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage.html) form SciPy package. Next flat clusters were formed on the previously calculated hierarchical clustering object using the SciPy [`fcluster()` function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster.html) with `distance` as the clusters forming criterion. The flat clusters with 2 or more members (i.e. genomes) were selected and clusters with a single member (i.e. singletons) were discarded as potential outliers or noise. Finally the cluster centroids (i.e. representative cluster genomes) were defined by the partition around medoids algorithm (PAM) via the [`fasterpam()`](https://python-kmedoids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) function from the `kmedoids` package. These cluster centroids formed the final list of *Escherichia* and *Shigella* genomes selected for the original GTDB sketch enhancement. Currently the MASH ECTyper species sketch contains 34,736 *Escherichia* and 4,627 *Shigella* genomes.

The ECTyper species identification module performance was tested and validated against the highly curated 493 genomes with species and cgMLST clustering data covering *Shigella flexneri*, *Shigella dysenteriae*, *Shigella boydii*, *Shigella sonnei* and *E.coli* species described by the [Iman Yassine et al.  2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28121-1)

### Serotyping module
Independent of the input type (FASTQ or FASTA) [the reference database of O and H antigen alleles](./ectyper/Data/ectyper_alleles_db.json) is being scanned. The best matching alleles hits for O antigen (`wzx`, `wzy`, `wzm`, `wzt`) and H antigen (mostly represented by `fliC` in addition to `flkA`, `fllA` and `flmA`) genes are ranked by maximizing BOTH `%identity` and `%coverage` values via the allele `gene score=(%identity*%coverage)/10000` using the [BLASTN](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) default run parameters. For O and H antigen the highest scoring antigen is reported. Since some O antigens display very high level of sequence similarity  represented by the 16 high similarity O groups delineated by the [Atsushi Iguchi et al. 2015](https://academic.oup.com/dnaresearch/article/22/1/101/442161?login=false), the mixed O antigen calls are possible separated  by the `\` symbol such as the group 9 that will be reported as `O17/O44/O73/O77/O106` mixed O serotype call. To account for any sequencing and other errors, if predicted O antigen is a member of the high similarity group, all O antigens in the group will be reported resulting in a mixed O antigen final call. The H antigens are better separated and are always reported as a single antigen call. For more serotyping details and benchmarking results please see the ECTyper v1.0.0 publication in the [Citation](#citation) section.

### Pathotyping module
Most of the E.coli samples are non-pathogenic, but some present public health risk and could lead from mild to sever health conditions. ECTyper currently supports typing of the 7 diarrheagenic *Escherichia coli* (DEC) pathotypes: DAEC, EAEC, EHEC, EIEC, EPEC, ETEC and STEC. Please note that the EHEC pathotype is being reported as `EHEC-STEC` as it is a STEC subtype that could cause bloody dysentery and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). 

This module uses highly curated database of the diagnostic pathotype markers listed in the [pathotype and toxin typing database](./ectyper/Data/ectyper_patho_stx_toxin_typing_database.json) in JSON format (see [Databases](#databases) section). The database was assembled by curating the existing literature and tools. Each database entry contains diagnostic marker accession number, nucleotide sequence and its length, gene symbol, source and other information in the following format:

```
{
  "accession": "QGG66503.1",
  "description": "intimin",
  "dnasequence": "ATGATTACTCATGGTTTTT...",
  "gene": "eae",
  "protsequence": "MITHGFYARTRHKHKLK...",
  "source": "https://github.com/B-UMMI/patho_typing/",
  "subtype": "-",
  "id": "28",
  "length_dnasequence": "2820"
}
```
Importantly the pathotype database under the `pathotypes` key contains the set of pathotyping classification gene-based rules that are used to predict a given E.coli pathotype from BLASTN output using the following format below. 

```
"EPEC": {
          "name": "Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli",
          "rules": {
          "16": {
                  "genes": [
                        "eae",
                        "!stx1",
                        "!stx2"
                    ],
                    "publication": "PMID:11403406"
                }
          }
}                
```
The `!` in front of the gene symbol (e.g., `!stx2` ) indicates the negation that is a given gene must NOT BE PRESENT in order to satisfy a given rule. 

Each pathotype classification rule might have one or more genes listed under the `genes` key. Each rule also has a corresponding publication reference under the `publication` key as an additional evidence and rule validity support. 

Each rule is tested for presence or absence of genes listed under the `genes` rule key. If all presence or absence conditions (i.e. the genes marked by the `!`) are met a given rule is considered to be valid and pathotype assigned.  Thus a given sample might have several rules that would concurrently apply that could lead to mixed pathotype prediction separated via the `/` symbol such as `ETEC/STEC`.

### Shiga toxin typing module
The Shiga toxin subtyping module supports typing of the *`stx1`* and *`stx2`* gene subtypes that is relevant both for epidemiological and risk assessment purposes (e.g., disease severity). This module also heavily relies on the [pathotype and toxin typing database](./ectyper/Data/ectyper_patho_stx_toxin_typing_database.json) (see [Databases](#databases) section).

Currently the database supports 
  * 4 **`stx1`** subtypes: *`stx1a`*, *`stx1c`*, *`stx1d`* and `stx1e`
  * 15 **`stx2`** subtypes: *`stx2a`*, *`stx2b`*, *`stx2c`*, *`stx2d`*, *`stx2e`*, *`stx2f`*, *`stx2g`* ,*`stx2h`*, *`stx2i`*, *`stx2j`*, *`stx2k`*,*`stx2l`*, *`stx2m`*, *`stx2n`*, *`stx2o`*.

The input sequences are queried against the *`stx1`* and *`stx2`* markers via BLASTN and top hits are being reported separated by the `;` symbol. The module supports the multi-copy `stx` gene presence by taking into account the genomic `stx` location attributes for each `stx` subtype (i.e. gene coordinates, contig location, overlap with other `stx` hits). The multi-copy `stx` gene reporting is not exhaustive (not all hits are being reported). That is if multiple `stx` hits are found in the input, the highest quality hit(s) per each non-overlapping `stx` gene range is being reported (i.e. single or multiple top hits are possible with the highest identical `bitscore` value as some hits could not be resolved due to sequence truncation). For example, if several `stx` allele hits have identical `bitscore` in a given `stx` gene range, all such hits are being reported.  Note that the `StxSubtypes` field lists only UNIQUE `stx` subtypes for the entire input sample such as `stx2e;stx2k` even if their genomic locations overlap or are identical due to truncated incomplete `stx` allele signatures. The `StxContigNames` and `StxCoordinates` lists all contig names and corresponding genomic coordinates for each listed `stx` type in the  `StxSubtypes` field according to the alphabetical order. This allows to easily spot `stx` subtypes with the same genomic coordinates. Finally, these fields allow to better understand `stx` alleles context/function and spot truncated alleles while providing genomic location context.  

### Quality Control (QC) module
To provide an easier interpretation of the results and typing metrics, following QC codes were developed. 
These codes allow to quickly filter "reportable" and "non-reportable" samples. The QC module is tightly linked to ECTyper allele database, specifically, `MinPident` and `MinPcov` fields.
For each reference allele minimum `%identity` and `%coverage` values were determined as a function of potential "cross-talk" between antigens (i.e. multiple potential antigen calls at a given setting).
The QC module covers the following serotyping scenarios. More scenarios might be added in future versions depending on user needs.

| QC flag          |      Explanation                                          | 
|------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|PASS (REPORTABLE) |Both O and H antigen alleles meet min `%identity` or `%coverage` thresholds (ensuring no antigen cross-talk) and single antigen predicted for O and H|
|FAIL (-:- TYPING) |Sample is E.coli and O and H antigens are not typed. Serotype:  -:- |
|WARNING MIXED O-TYPE|A mixed O antigen call is predicted requiring wet-lab confirmation |
|WARNING (WRONG SPECIES)| A sample is non-E.coli (e.g. *E.albertii*, *Shigella*, etc.) based on RefSeq assemblies|
|WARNING (-:H TYPING)| A sample is E.coli and O antigen is not predicted (e.g. -:H18)|
|WARNING (O:- TYPING)| A sample is E.coli and H antigen is not predicted (e.g. O17:-)|
|WARNING (O NON-REPORT)|O antigen alleles do not meet min %identity or %coverage thresholds|
|WARNING (H NON-REPORT)|H antigen alleles do not meet min %id or %cov thresholds|
|WARNING (O and H NON-REPORT)| Both O and H antigen alleles do not meet min %identity or %coverage thresholds|

8. **GeneScores**: ECTyper O and H antigen gene scores in 0 to 1 range
9. **AllelesKeys**: Best matching `ECTyper` database allele keys used to call the serotype  
10. **GeneIdentities(%)**: `%identity` values of the query alleles
11. **GeneCoverages(%)**: `%coverage` values of the query alleles
12. **GeneContigNames**: the contig names where the query alleles were found
13. **GeneRanges**: genomic coordinates of the query alleles
14. **GeneLengths**: allele lengths of the query alleles

## FAQ

**Does ECTyper can be run on multiple samples in a directory?**

ECTyper proves flexible ways to specify inputs located in different locations. One can provide multiple paths to several directories separated by space. In addition, one can specify file type to look for in a given directory(ies). Note that paths that contain a star `*` symbol would only look for files in specified directory and would not look in subdirectories. For example,

- Process all files in `folder1` and `folder2` directories and file `sample.fasta` located in `folder3` 

    `ectyper -i folder1/ folder2/ folder3/sample.fasta -o ectyper_results` 
- Process all fasta files in `folder1` and all fastq files in `folder2`. All sub-directories in those 2 folders will be ignored. To process those sub-folders either specify path to them or provide paths to directories without the `*` wildcard symbol. 
  
  `ectyper -i folder1/*.fasta folder2/*.fastq` 

**Why ECTyper sometimes provides serotype results separated by forward  slash / for O-antigen**

Some O-antigens display very high degree of homology and are very hard to discern even using wet-lab agglutination assays. Even using both `wzx` and `wzy` genes it is not possible to reliably resolve those O-antigens. The 16 high similarity groups were identified by [Joensen, Katrine G., et al.](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/jcm.00008-15). Thus, if a given O-antigen is a member of any of those high similarity groups, all potential O-antigens are reported separated by `/` such as group 9 reported as `O17/O44/O73/O77/O106`.
